# Processing Experiments

This is a setup that works off the [Hype Framework](http://www.hypeframework.org/), processing and [Joshua Davis'](http://www.skillshare.com/classes/design/Programming-Graphics-I-Introduction-to-Generative-Art/782118657) Skillshare course.  It is meant to quickly set up the environment.

## Using Bower

Given that the [HYPE Processing framework](https://github.com/hype/HYPE_Processing) is under heavy development, this has been connected via Bower.  Bower will make it easy to easily check for the latest status of the git repository.  To intstall Bower, first install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and then go to [Bower.io](http://bower.io/).  When you have both install run:

```bash
# Update HYPE docs, data, information
# Which will be stored inside the bower_components folder

bower install
```
